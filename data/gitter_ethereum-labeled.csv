@Arachnid ...if your tx needs say 1 M gas... every time miner creates a block..it may not accommodate your tx after spending gas for other transactions added to the block ... so it will depend on the probability of your tx making in block before other pending txs.;0;;;;;;;;;

@Arachnid Yes I tried `estimateGas`, thank you. After a lot of head scratching and help from a fellow developer I discovered the problem: I was passing `bytecode` from the Solidity compiler directly to the `data` field of the transaction. Because it wasn't prepended with `0x`, Ethereum decided that it wasn't hex and re-encoded it, creating garbage opcodes that probably had a loop in it which drained all of the gas.;0;;;;;;;;;
@Arachnid you actually failed by that very metric;0;;;;;;;;;
@Arachnid you're everywhere!;0;;;;;;;;;
@ArEnSc the node sync is going to be a bitch, it is definitely sitting at the door of 20GBs right now;1;;;;;;;;;
"@arhuaco fuck yeah ;-)";1;;;;;;;;;

@bradleat had you tried setting geth to higher niceness? [mac] sudo renice -n -10 -p PID;0;;;;;;;;;
@bradleat the problem is two-fold.  First: there are a lot of junk peers on the network nowadays (generally idiots who forked Ethereum for one reason or another).  Second, a lot of peers are transient.  Every time you kill and restart `geth`, for example, all of the nodes that were connected to yours are now carrying dead peer information.  Although it can be frustrating your best bet is to start `geth` and leave it alone unless so that it can settle in to a stable state unless it is reporting errors;1;;;;;;;;;

@ChrisCates The reason you are talking to a woman, is that (sorry) you want to have sex with her or have her company, the shocking thing is that they know ! , so you were probably the 20th guy that told her so in the day, week,month. How is that helping your situation ?;1;;;;;;;;;

 ^ Not nice. You are new here and are missing context. Mud-slinging is not the way to win friends.
 
 The cross-build technology used here (https://github.com/karalabe/xgo) and @karalabe, who put together the process has an exemplary understanding of build technology. When I started my own journey to bring Ethereum to resource-constrained devices (http://doublethink.co) I had originally intended to work on both Go and C++ cross-builds, but it quickly became apparent that the Go team had no need whatsoever of my help. They had things utterly in-hand. PÃ©ter especially!
 
 In both cases (see http://github.com/doublethinkco/webthree-umbrella-cross for the C++ equivalent), we are building GENERIC cross-builds, rather than cross-builds targeting specific devices. Obviously a single ARM7 binary, whether cross-built or native-built cannot be optimal for all ARM7 devices. 
 
 At the **current time**, the better solution **if you really care about performance** is to use native builds, which is possible on nearly all hardware which can currently run Ethereum. The ARM builds, for example, are mainly used on SBCs. Until we have working Light Client support, it isn't feasible to use Ethereum on most really small embedded devices anyway. That work is coming soon, though.
 
 You can check out the Go team's 6-month-long ""in a branch"" process towards Light Client in http://github.com/ethereum/light-client. I just got a grant which will help me keep working towards catching them up on C++ (http://doublethink.co/2016/02/23/we-have-blockgrantx-funding/).

@frozeman i think this is what you are looking for https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mining;0;;;;;;;;;
@frozeman in the project root, delete Godeps/_workspace/pkg;0;;;;;;;;;
@frozeman itâ€™s `$GOPATH/src/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum`;0;;;;;;;;;
@frozeman why dont you redirect logs instead of loglevel 0 ?;0;;;;;;;;;
@frozeman You around?;0;;;;;;;;;
@frozeman you can run the rpc with `geth blocktest ../../tests/files/BlockTests/bcJS_API_Test.json JS_API_Tests rpc` ;0;;;;;;;;;
@frozeman you still donâ€™t have the private key in your geth session;0;;;;;;;;;
@fultonm it appears as though you are mining. Albeit with a VERY low hashrate.;0;;;;;;;;;
@furusiyya  of cause why not there is alway the coinbase tx in the block. You can mine all the ether you want in your private chain. ;0;;;;;;;;;
"@furusiyya What are you trying to estimate gas for? You can't estimate gas for ""a bytecode"", you need to estimate gas for some particular operation.";0;;;;;;;;;

@Gustav-Simonsson generally I think the 2/3 method doesn't work becuase of the spikey nature of gas per block;0;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson Heeeeeyyyy... psssst... don't spoil my secret;0;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson I had a debate about this with @obscuren a while back. Thing is, the tx is valid, just does crap. ;1;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson I hate to break it to you, but the hex is valid ;0;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson I have already mined block, no need to estimate, need to calc full reward for block mined;0;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson I remember selling off BTC mining GPUs was pretty damn tedious. (tested each one because I didn't want any returns/complaints/blah);1;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson its is not the invalid block thats the problem but that mining stalls! its a bug;0;;;;;;;;;
"@Gustav-Simonsson Meaning... ""shit, I definitely can't deploy what I'm trying to deploy. I'll just wait until the gas increases."" and then it never does because lots of people are stumped by the low ceiling";1;;;;;;;;;
@Gustav-Simonsson or... have a gas estimate that works! hahhahaha;0;;;;;;;;;

@jambtt It's the nature of a blockchain. Decentralized consensus is expensive (because of hardware and network constraints...)

@jmiehau I'm fixing this issue too in my https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/1275 PR.

@karalabe I am wondering how to connect it to my private chain;0;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe I assume you're thinking of an EVM backend for LLVM. That would be all kinds of awesome, but a hell of a lot of work.;1;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe I ran fsck.ext4 on it and it seems to be OK. The USB Stick is a brand new SanDisk USB thumbdrive so there should not be a problem with wear of the flash cells.;0;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe I see it specifies a different data-dir in dev mode, but when I try it, it still uses the same keystore. Is this right?;0;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe I think there's a bug. My peers keep getting killed off.;0;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe I was seeing those on my Mac too and decided to nuke my db and sync form net;0;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe I was told you are the person to talk to about JSON-RPC over IPC? In particular, it doesn't appear that any enveloping is happening which means (I believe) that it is not possible to correctly separate messages in a way that is recoverable from malformed payload problems. I was wondering if you can point me to what Geth does to deal with this problem on receiving side and if Geth does anything on the send side to make it easier for clients to parse the stream?;0;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe i would like to submit a PR changing that `Pending bool` to `BlockNo *big.Int` so we can call smartcontract const func at a blocknumber, what do you think?;0;;;;;;;;;

@karalabe Thanks for the network tip. Feel stupid not thinking that the issue could be caused by saturated upload.;1;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe that's actually the case I have. Thanks for fucking it up with a minor release.;1;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe That's ridiculous, as if they'd use such a labor-intensive process.;1;;;;;;;;;
@karalabe the problem is that I can create a tx without actual funds and propagate it to network, later when you got funds, your tx will be confirmed and I think this is not damn acceptable;1;;;;;;;;;

> and then I kill the geth and turn on the geth again.

Don't kill your geth - it'll sync from other peers. Killing it makes it re-read your transactions.rlp (which seemingly is not empty?)";0;;;;;;;;;
@keech for example when you set the gas too low and your tx is stuck in mempool;0;;;;;;;;;
"@kenji-isuntv yeah not sure. admin.nodeInfo genesis field is exactly matching in all three nodes however ""head"" value is different.";0;;;;;;;;;
@KenoLeon but girls only want one night stands from what I've seen.;1;;;;;;;;;
@KenoLeon I don't believe the wallet was uninitialized. The weakness was a lot more subtle than that. I am not going to go into detail because it could potentially be abused. I'd rather have bad guys think it was a stupid omission. ;1;;;;;;;;;
@KenoLeon You think you can deploy it on Rinkeby and initialize it, since you already have the process down. I'd like to do some hunting.;0;;;;;;;;;
@keo adding to that, even though your reward for mining a block on the test net is 1.5E, the blocks are full of gigantic transactions, and you as the miner get to keep the gas_used * gas_price;0;;;;;;;;;
@keo You get ether from mining with the Olympic version. But these ethers will all be discarded when Frontier start. However, for every block you mine during Olympic, you will get a reward when Frontier starts.;0;;;;;;;;;

@MartinLechny Yes, it wery slow.;1;;;;;;;;;
@mathcrypto if you set 4.7M gas and the network gas limit is 4.2M your tx won't be mined until **the whole network of miners** raises the gas limit;0;;;;;;;;;
@mathcrypto Your testnet and geth folders will each hold keystores for you, I don't know what system you are on, IPC can be both Testnet txs and Main net, depends on what you are doing, when I transact between my accounts on Main net they go over IPC and then I have to hope that an RPC peer will mine my transaction.;0;;;;;;;;;
@mattfriendly I am suspicious that Geth forces disk sync, and therefore does not allow internal disk caching to work properly. 8GB SSD is plenty big to dump a lot of blocks into it.;0;;;;;;;;;
@mattfriendly Well, I started from chaindata I had already. I copied the old chunk into RAM, synced in RAM, copied data out of RAM into RAID, and continued syncing in RAID. I think I have an insight now what is screwing everything. I lost sync again, when I rebooted the machine and forgot to do something first.  The stupid geth messes up the chaindata in such a way that is no longer possible to sync on disk because all the timestamps are out of wack.;1;;;;;;;;;

@mcdee because of 0 balance , i am unable to deploy contract through truffle on rinkeby testnet.;0;;;;;;;;;
@mcdee I see where I messed up.... Thanks Jim you saved me from banging me head on the desk;0;;;;;;;;;
@mcdee I'd embarrass myself if I told you.;0;;;;;;;;;
@mcdee Maybe a stupid idea, but what about bounties for hacking into accounts and draining that ether to a secure place?;1;;;;;;;;;
"@mcdee So what you are telling me I will always be behind 50-100 blocks from ""real-time"" ?";0;;;;;;;;;
@mcdee thank you for the tip. One is supposed to do it throught `ethclient.Client`, right?;0;;;;;;;;;
"@mcdee Thanks, I tried to not set any gas price at all `//transactOpts.setGasPrice(DEFAULT_GAS_PRICE);` but the same error occurs anyway. Any clues?";0;;;;;;;;;
@mcdee: Yes... I got those because I stopped the mining on the node, so the transactions got queued. When I execute them normally, that's when I get the message. I stopped the mining because I wanted to capture the nonce.;0;;;;;;;;;

@michbil your geth 1.4.13 isn't fork-compatible, there testnet was forked with the mainnet, so re-sync the chain with the latest geth;0;;;;;;;;;

@miohtama You can't start mining immediately;0;;;;;;;;;
@MitchK Got it. gas price is actually 22 gwei. ethgasstation seems to be useless. ;0;;;;;;;;;
@mjackson001 Killed means the process got shot down by the pm usually because it has taken up to much memory (running a VM?). I donâ€™t know how much memory you have available but considering the silly â€œattacksâ€ on the test net, youâ€™ll need quite a bit of RAM until this mess is over.;0;;;;;;;;;
@mjackson001 Thanks for the detailed instruction about setting up a private cluster;0;;;;;;;;;
@mjdillon X10 sucked. Insteon was awesome. (But I guess it didn't reach a large audience because of the high cost.);1;;;;;;;;;

@neerajsaran Sorry, I missreaded you;0;;;;;;;;;
@nejucomo indeed if you're not synced, then the worst that should happen is that the transaction has an invalid nonce and is discarded by the network;0;;;;;;;;;
@nejucomo my statement assumes that you've not stored any non-blockchain stuff on your geth node (in its local leveldb) because obviously that'd be wiped when you destroy the node;0;;;;;;;;;
@nicksavers It prevents 1.4.9 clients from syncing with pro-fork or anti-fork chains, to make certain they know they can choose.;0;;;;;;;;;

@sitarane There is an Atom extension for Ethereum highlighting (Solidity and Serpent).;0;;;;;;;;;
@skarred14 Check `txpool.inspect`, you might be having a nonce gap in your transactions, causing subsequent ones to be blocked from inclusion;0;;;;;;;;;
@skydogch Ethereum transactions are compatible across networks. Which means, that if you use the same account on the test network, that you have on the live network, then all transactions executed on the test network can be replayed on the live network. This was the issue why it was such a pain in the ass to give out the Olympic rewards. Normally, you should never ever use the same accounts on multiple networks. However, as an added precaution, we modified the IDs from where transactions start on the test network so that an accidental crossover doesn't open up too many vulnerabilities.;1;;;;;;;;;
@sman2013 those are compiler warnings for a vendored package, but ok. just ugly;1;;;;;;;;;

@tarrencev tell miners they should be setting different gas price limits when they start their miner...;0;;;;;;;;;
@tcoulter you make it sound like the turn-up is the fault of us;0;;;;;;;;;
@tdantas_gitlab  you don't need a tx to mine a block. It will just mine empty blocks;0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring  @Gustav-Simonsson @fjl ;0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring  I got the node working. Showing up in the https://stats.ethdev.com/ . Now I have to figure out what the heck is this all about !;0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring , the eth.gasPrice is 50_000_000_000. My transaction use gasPrice = 50_000_000_000 (network gas price)  and  gaslimit = 3_000_000_000. The result of the web3.eth.sendRawTransactio is `Exceeds block gas limit`. How can I calculate the right values? I am a little bit confuse because I don't get my transaction executed;0;;;;;;;;;
"@tgerring dude you are a terminator! lol ;)";1;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring forgot to merge those tests! damn, I'm loosing it!;1;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring hey terminator you ready! :);0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring I worry that people from /r/bitcoin would not even get the word.;0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring lol that's when the real madness begins!;0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring ok thanks for the info.  Man you're always here kicking A$$ and taking names!  i appreciate it!;1;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring ok thanks for the info. Man you're always here kicking A$$ and taking names! i appreciate it!;1;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring stop developing geth? :D;0;;;;;;;;;
@tgerring wtf;1;;;;;;;;;
@thegostep run `web3.eth.syncing` and you can compare the highest block with your current block;0;;;;;;;;;
@theonlyjames you are not even halfway synced on Mainnet, you cannot mine a chain you aren't fully synced on.  You will see geth say miner is commiting new work on a block if you are mining, whether you succeed in mining that block or not.;0;;;;;;;;;
@Thisisgodzilla Did you backup your keystore?  The keystore has encryption keys necessary to retrieve your Ether.  If you did not back it up, I don't believe you can retrieve the ether, the private keys it generated for yer account are in the keystore.  ALWAYS backup yer keystore when you make new accounts.;0;;;;;;;;;

"@tinybike - I was being an idiot. I had restarted my tesnet with NO peers!
The weird thing is, MIST still gets transactions approved but normal Txn donâ€™t.";1;;;;;;;;;
@tinybike `gasPrice * gasLimit` is deducted prior starting the execution (and then the difference is refunded) - so you cannot execute without a balance in the account, unless `gasPrice = 0`;0;;;;;;;;;
@tinybike can you expand on what issues youâ€™re seeing?;0;;;;;;;;;
"@tinybike damn it. Circle has ""Merchant Category Code (MCC): 6051"", which in some instances according to their FAQ, may trigger a cash advance fee";1;;;;;;;;;
@tinybike damn just remembered, there is a JS implementation of Ethereum, did you see that one?;1;;;;;;;;;
@tinybike someone mining shitty blocks?;1;;;;;;;;;
@tinybike wtf. huge crowdsale, lol.;1;;;;;;;;;
@tinybike you need to upgrade you git to the latest, then `make` will work ok;0;;;;;;;;;
@tjade273  @Gustav-Simonsson  I am glad it makes some sense .;0;;;;;;;;;
@TOMOAKI12345 generate an arbitrary genesis block and you can run your own private net with it;0;;;;;;;;;
@TOMOAKI12345 The client's are limited to not accept transactions;0;;;;;;;;;
"@transhumanbob_twitter @samlavery re the Estonian crypto-fiat initiative https://github.com/cryptofiat/contract shared some notes here http://kaarmann.com/euro-2-0-built-on-weekends/

During the first weekend we built the solidity contract and a wrapper around ethereum to hide gas payments and remove the need for ether. It all worked fine based on docs, we just felt re-inveting the wheel compared to everyone else, who has built contracts/API around ethereum before. 

For the next weekend 1-2 Oct would love to have one of with ethereum chops on the team who can tell us when we're being idiots. We're hoping to get BIP-32 HD keys working in the EUR reference wallet and figure out obfuscation of fiat money flows.

@thehighfiveghost suggested  here is where the folks hang out, who could be intrigued enough to take a weekend in Tallinn (we'll cover flights & nights). DM if this talks to you.";0;;;;;;;;;
@tranvictor what u want... ? nonce of a mined block ? ;0;;;;;;;;;
@traycho_twitter you might be better off asking in the infura channel;0;;;;;;;;;
@triple9dice oh i should guess it by your nickname :) not all russians are stupid tho :);1;;;;;;;;;
"@twistatbat_twitter 
`web3.toDecimal(""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056bc75e2d63100000"")`
This is done in `IPC` but what about in `JSONRpc`";0;;;;;;;;;
@twistatbat_twitter That value is ABI encoded, it's not a plain hex value. Look up the Contract ABI encoding wiki page for details ;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat , I will try a different networkid and I will delete the datadir, maybe it helps;0;;;;;;;;;
"@tymat ah! why use HTTPS: because browsers hate mixed content of HTTP/HTTPS. ;)";1;;;;;;;;;
"@tymat ah! why use HTTPS: because browsers hate mixed content of HTTP/HTTPS. ;)";0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat CLL insanity from a year ago: https://github.com/linagee/learn-ethereum/blob/master/subcurrency_cll_explained.png;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat damn limitations. please help me work around them. :(;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat damnit. Gyft would be so slow and I only have an existing card with $0.29 of pizza, lol. :-D;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat do you mean keep the 40GB crap that has been piling in the blockchain? No, no. Bad idea! :P;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat ethminer doesn't do anything with txs. It just takes the final state params (i.e. Block header without nonce) and uses that to mine and find a nonce. ;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat everyone here are witnesses!;0;;;;;;;;;
"@tymat for the totally paranoid before storing any cryptocurrency. :-D
```
sudo cat /dev/urandom | rngtest -c 1000
```";0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat fuck yeah lets collab;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat hey I know, let's make a giant airship full of explosive fuel, lol....;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat how do you learn BS skills like he did in the video?;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat I did as per the web site > bash <(curl https://install-eth.ethereum.org -L);0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat I envision a future in which quality of videos doesn't have to be crap like this!;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat I hope that didn't make you anxious-er. ^^^;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat I see kind of a huge chicken and egg problem with this. :(;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat i think you're being a little disingenuous in your complaint;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat it should work with the latest EVM instructions and jump rules :D;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat Note, if you cannot complete the entire TCP, protocol and ecryption hadnshake in that amount of time, you drop... this would kill cpu-weak peers as they would get constantly hammered by dropping connections;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat oh god. what have I started. it's a monster! https://github.com/linagee/linkoin;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat real life friend did the whole GNAA thing. it felt shameful every time he talked about it. I was always like: I don't get it. why?;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat so the contract you pasted above lives here? 0xa1e4380a3b1f749673e270229993ee55f35663b4;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat that usually indicates there wasnâ€™t enough gas;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat that was throwing weird errors about URI encoding or something;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat then we'd have to find that person and shut it off;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat there we go. Cyrillic would be easier for me to understand :D;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat we may have just made the silliest transaction in the history of cryptocurrency. :-D;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat what the hell is Bittrex doing? hahahah.....??;1;;;;;;;;;
"@tymat what the hell??
""Gas Used: 89,885""";1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you have your own troll? lol. and they were creative it looks like.;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you hustler ;1;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you just downloaded something of swarm :-);0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you may not be able to do that (20+ nodes). of course, I'm assuming I know what you're talking about and purposely trying to keep this all ambiguous as possible. muhahah. :);0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you messed up!!!;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you said earlyer that geth has a hardcoded limit for max 64 open files;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymat you're supposed to send a greet when you create it, lol;0;;;;;;;;;
@tymay you were or weren't be able to with that?;0;;;;;;;;;
@ujjwalagrawal17  which testnet are you talking about? you probably want to find a faucet.;0;;;;;;;;;
@Urketadic_twitter if you are aiming for an erc20  keep totalSupply and ditch initial Supply.;0;;;;;;;;;
@usafootballer how long did it take to mine those 5 blocks?;0;;;;;;;;;
@usafootballer Sometimes the mk_ command fails. Run it again.;0;;;;;;;;;
@usafootballer you selling your ether or holding for a while?;0;;;;;;;;;
@v4nz666 `/usr/bin` if you install from repository, `$GOPATH/bin` if you `go get` it;0;;;;;;;;;

"@VoR0220 creepy. better not piss them off or they will kickban you globally from ""money"". lol....";1;;;;;;;;;
@VoR0220 put a waranty on the library **DONâ€™T BE A FUCKING MORON. DONâ€™T SEND ETHER** :-D;1;;;;;;;;;
"@VoR0220 weird. I tried this:
var theGreeter = greeterContract.at(web3.toBigNumber('0x3dbdeeafa2aca6c8c4f6e442b07bb575fc5658a9'))
and now instead of a BigNumber error I get:
```

@VoR0220: `geth attach` doesn't work?;0;;;;;;;;;
@wanderer `--nodiscover attach console` , then `admin.addPeer(enode)`  ;0;;;;;;;;;
@wardloockx IMO it's best to set up a private chain locally and test there;0;;;;;;;;;
@xlcrr `kill 784` should do the trick;0;;;;;;;;;
@yapjiaqing thank you for the response ? it's odd though, because when I start with 'geth --chainid 4' it works fine.;0;;;;;;;;;

@zelig As far as I know, Whisper will be utterly crippled in Frontier and more or less disabled, so...;0;;;;;;;;;
@zelig giving me a heart attack. need more ether! lol;1;;;;;;;;;
@zelig hoping @aperseghin faked the console output as a sophisticated Aprils fool joke :);0;;;;;;;;;

@zelig i added the fix for eth_gasPrice returning gas instead of gasprice in my PR #817 ;0;;;;;;;;;

@zelig is stuck on shit for hours. recruiting @zsfelfoldi 's smarts --- contract storage addressing is a bitch;1;;;;;;;;;

@zigguratt  indeed but I want to test them and in order to test them I guess I have to deploy them and send some ether right?;0;;;;;;;;;
@zigguratt the problem is his french is not understandable even for me (i'm French);0;;;;;;;;;
@Ziya_Sadr_twitter do you have the transaction hash or just the receiving address?;0;;;;;;;;;
@ZomLLin_twitter why they needs db locks? most protocols backed by cachyng ;0;;;;;;;;;

 it seems that geth using hdd read at 40mb/s and still importing a block within 10 minutes. 
 if attacker execute the same extcodesize in each transaction
 geth might use some cache and skip hdd state reading 
 that should increase block import speed";0;;;;;;;;;

and it doesnâ€™t appear to be screwing up on my backbook;1;;;;;;;;;
and it would be slow as hell;1;;;;;;;;;
and itâ€™s way easier to fuck them up;1;;;;;;;;;
And it's also a bitch to test since every change needs the 20h sync test :P;1;;;;;;;;;
and it's silly to think that if Ethereum exhausts funding that the project will just somehow end;0;;;;;;;;;
and just for the record, it annoys the hell out of me :)));1;;;;;;;;;
and killed it;0;;;;;;;;;
and make sure there isn't something in your network that's screwing up the TCP/IP routes;1;;;;;;;;;
And miners don't spend their hashrate for wasting at useless chain;0;;;;;;;;;
And no fucking info as always, where go, where read, this is so damn it annoying already;1;;;;;;;;;
And not even documented there. The call is traceTransaction: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/develop/eth/api.go#L1803;0;;;;;;;;;
and not hammer shitty ones;1;;;;;;;;;
And now my peers went away. Damned microwave oven in the other room, lol.;1;;;;;;;;;

And that is mainnet and testnet.;0;;;;;;;;;
and that's how Netflix and Reddit go down simultaneously kids :D;0;;;;;;;;;
and the NSA who would be dying to hire you;1;;;;;;;;;
And the only way to make sure itâ€™s not, is by applying the same **message** (transaction or CALL) as reported by the miner that validated the original message.;0;;;;;;;;;
and the remaining 4.5GB is used by the kernel to save disk writes and reads;0;;;;;;;;;
and the stats are not really relevant, since the test net was mostly empty;0;;;;;;;;;

and there it seems to hang forever, can somebody help me out here? This is massively annoying...;1;;;;;;;;;

And we also want to add some resilienc to connectovity issues after that;0;;;;;;;;;

And what's the difference between geth --testnet console, and geth --testnet?;0;;;;;;;;;
and when i call the function in remix it works perfectly fine;0;;;;;;;;;

and who the fuck is Craig Wright lol;1;;;;;;;;;
And who the Hell is Travis? I thought Geth was being maintained by someone else. @karalabe;1;;;;;;;;;
And yes, you can compare those two things, but I'd suggest that trying to prevent other contracts calling you is an antipattern.;0;;;;;;;;;
and youâ€™d have to hack up the source ;0;;;;;;;;;
and your `enode://08622fab0c0b4f6268976eb8678ae4bc72271d726825d4a8a60034a7436ae199081294c4c35875a2ca65e8f2bfee3e7d26f727d96a39815d523b150805aff913` is the value returned by `admin.nodeInfo.enode` on the ubuntu machine?;0;;;;;;;;;
Another stupid question: Will the list of receipts for a block always be the same length and order as the list of transactions?;0;;;;;;;;;
another thing is: as a block fills up, the oracle decides to charge more. (damned oracle!);1;;;;;;;;;

btw2: it also contains a shitload of polishes in the downloader tests, I was bored on the train home so I went through and patched them up a bit;1;;;;;;;;;
building c++ takes freaking ages;1;;;;;;;;;
bunch of showoffs;1;;;;;;;;;
but after the sync fuckup;1;;;;;;;;;
but all that aside Iâ€™m with you on the wtf comment;1;;;;;;;;;
but by editing `protocolversion`, we don't have this problem any more;0;;;;;;;;;

but docker for now creates a new layer from each build step, so the more you have, the more junk your image will accumulate;0;;;;;;;;;

"but I still get â€œExceeds block gas limitâ€ for ""gas"":""0x02faf468""";0;;;;;;;;;
but I will say it is less of a discussion and more of just a shitshow.;1;;;;;;;;;
but if it build on everything except that one build slave, then we should fix that and not screw up the code;1;;;;;;;;;
but if it fills up its connections with crappy nodes (i.e. those lagging begind on nethstats);1;;;;;;;;;
but if you add further miners, it will screw with block times a lot;1;;;;;;;;;
but if you are refering to my accidentle PR earlier, shit happens.;1;;;;;;;;;
But it accumulated too much garbage imho;0;;;;;;;;;
but it can't fix all the crappy blocks that are already in the chain;1;;;;;;;;;
but its not impossible, but damn near it lol;1;;;;;;;;;
But maybe lucky again since I am a maniac I would kill myself with one of those things.;1;;;;;;;;;
but miner.start will run and get you ether no matter what;0;;;;;;;;;

For code, you can set it as having some dummy code in your genesis.json;0;;;;;;;;;
"for example:

with dummy.js being 
```js
console.log(JSON.stringify(eth.accounts));

Such code seems to deliver the following message ""someday in the future the devs may not be around what will you do then"" or ""well can you really trust the devs"" OMG Centralization... !  Nooooooooo!  ~_~ meh.  Aeron B. gave the example of driving a bus with respect to decentralized systems vs centralized.  Sometimes you need a centralized bus driver.

Fourth, if it really has gone missing then please be aware that restarting the way that you have will cause a full sync (note the `Blockchain not empty, fast sync disabled` message).  So if you do need to retart blow away your `DATADIR\geth` directory (take care to keep `DATADIR\keystore`) before restarting;0;;;;;;;;;

I also have a question. Does eth.sign() currently work so the output can be decrypted again into a legible message?;0;;;;;;;;;
I also prefer karalabe's solution. If you give a higher reward, it will be more likely that the job will be executed  by some miner.;0;;;;;;;;;

I have a very old (pre-Olympic version 1) key json, generated by geth.  The ciphertext is 48 bytes long and it is encrypted using aes-128-cbc (not aes-128-ctr like the newer keys).  So...stupid question: does this mean that this is a 48-byte private key? :/;0;;;;;;;;;

I imagine if you can fast sync past the bad nodes you'd be fine, until another bad tx was sent out, which is probably a minute after you're done fast syncing, then you'd have to start over again;0;;;;;;;;;
I imagine it will increase once ether hits the exchanges;0;;;;;;;;;

I think a cron service would generally be useful for shorter term schedules;0;;;;;;;;;
i think beacause my private blockchain need to have the same blocksizelimit ??;0;;;;;;;;;
I think being down in the guts of the machine is giving @obscuren a cynical frame-of-mind...start seeing the chinks in the armor too clearly and pointing em out;0;;;;;;;;;
I think cryptos are best when they are cheap and accessible and climb in value at a slow and projected rate.;0;;;;;;;;;
I think Erlang has a very low barrier entry to start hacking, but a huge barrier of entry to actually release and deploy stuff (i.e. shitty tooling);1;;;;;;;;;
I think eth will go down in the history books as the c++ program with the most pretty logging but also the most useless;1;;;;;;;;;
I think fees are less of a problem, the more interesting things are the security of the distributed storage (as it how to secure the system so as to noone can play it (use resources for free, waste available resources, etc));0;;;;;;;;;
I think Google's general strategy is to shoot all over the place and then take the credit for any arrows that hit :D;0;;;;;;;;;

I think it's something stupid I'm doing. But I have hit my knowledge limits...;0;;;;;;;;;
I think that it may be due time synchronization issue, so, I used this `sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com` to update my time, and restarted the `geth node`, but it still not working.;0;;;;;;;;;

Just sending in lat/lng won't guarantee provenance, it's easy to hack. You probably need to reconsider the problem that you're trying to solve and how the blockchain can handle it.

But it doesn't exactly state that in the instructions, perhaps i am out of my league...but it does seem a bit of an assumption from that greeter instructional, though I was forwarned this was geared for the developer.

And then you get idiots like me [saying things like this](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/05/17/ea-senior-engineer-the-wii-u-is-crap), and your employer really doesn't like it.

ok dumb question: using web3_sha3, `0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64` hashes to `0x47173285a8d7341e5e972fc677286384f802f8ef42a5ec5f03bbfa254cb01fad`;1;;;;;;;;;
ok enough for gitter. This is for geth. But that is clearly a scam. I know about Trump.;1;;;;;;;;;
"OK guys, in my Monday morning haze, can somebody please help me with a couple of my stupid questions;
1) Can Morden still be used, at all? Or is it completely 'gone'?
2) Do I need Geth 1.5+ to run Ropsten?
3) Are there any block explorers for Ropsten yet? (lol, too soon?)";0;;;;;;;;;
ok guys. seriously. i have shown patience. 4 days now trying to sync damn morden.;1;;;;;;;;;
ok hang let me restart without nodediscover;0;;;;;;;;;
ok i can kill my chain.  but i think we should file a bug on this ?;0;;;;;;;;;
ok I killed it, got rid of chain data, and retarted with discovery ON;0;;;;;;;;;
ok ill get off my anti-religion rant ;1;;;;;;;;;
ok im up on netstats (screwed up the case for the key) ;1;;;;;;;;;
"ok one of you pm me ""WS_SECRET"" please. i tried asking @obscuren and was met with sarcasm and tomfoolery (as expected) ";0;;;;;;;;;
ok so if you started your geth on the wrong genesis block? What will happen? Must you delete everything and start over?;0;;;;;;;;;
ok so something is fucky ;1;;;;;;;;;
ok so.. get on that shit lol ;1;;;;;;;;;
ok sour puss, take a nap;1;;;;;;;;;
Ok thanks, these moronic rumours are always soulds like bullshit, just wanted clear statement from devs for my client;1;;;;;;;;;
Ok this one starts a geth (ethereum node) instance when I run it it should be good to go for you;0;;;;;;;;;
OK time to nuke all go folders and fetch everything from scratch;0;;;;;;;;;
ok wait, what the heck;1;;;;;;;;;
OK, am still learning how the Ethereum system works, the DAO hack scared me, sounds like a lot of people lost their asses, i don't believe I'll ever have enough ether to really worry about it, but if I did, I would like to believe it is secure.;1;;;;;;;;;
"ok, I decided to increase the nonce until there is no more ""Nonce too low"" error :)";0;;;;;;;;;
OK, I figured out what was wrong: ethminer -F http://eth-eu.dwarfpool.com:80/0xwallet_id is what I needed, the instructions on this site are fucked up: https://linuxconfig.org/begin-mining-ethereum-on-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus-linux;1;;;;;;;;;
ok, I have a shit-ton of log output;1;;;;;;;;;
ok, Iâ€™ll file a bug with the relevant info that we collected above. thanks!;0;;;;;;;;;
Ok, maybe I should stop before I get punched in the nose :));1;;;;;;;;;
ok, more dumb newbie questions, so I created a transaction with the simplestorage code.  How do I access that contract?;0;;;;;;;;;
Ok, next question: with geth should I use --testnet or --olympic for interactive testing? What's the difference? How can I get test-ether?;0;;;;;;;;;
ok, ok! GO GETH! GO!;0;;;;;;;;;
Ok, that screwed your sync :P;1;;;;;;;;;
Ok. Can you, in another terminal, start `geth attach`;0;;;;;;;;;
ok.........wtf, raw transactions suddenly started working for me again;1;;;;;;;;;
okay, in that case iâ€™ll remove them ;0;;;;;;;;;
Okay, that's fairly well documented - see the 'go' section where it talks about cors: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC;0;;;;;;;;;
Okay..it finally worked@!!@#$!#  I was lame.. running the code so many times and not letting it mine !! ;0;;;;;;;;;
Okay..it finally worked@!!@#$!# I was lame.. running the code so many times and not letting it mine !!;0;;;;;;;;;
OMFG ;1;;;;;;;;;
omfg changelly.com scammed me wtf;1;;;;;;;;;
omg guys... and i thought i was gonna get in trouble for posting a snoop video! lmao ;0;;;;;;;;;
OMG I improved so much the quality of my node by blocking ETC node ip addresses in my firewall! My avg propagation time is 5 ms!!!!;0;;;;;;;;;
omg kraken noobs, they have eth but you cant fund your account with eth. How are the whales supposed to dump eth on the market?;0;;;;;;;;;
Omg man good bless you , sorry I`m so stupid;0;;;;;;;;;
omg perfectly on launch the cpp-ethereum team must make gazillions of commits causing my build agent to destroy my CPU power...what the hell is wrong with them;1;;;;;;;;;
omg polonibots***! sry spam im leaving now lol;1;;;;;;;;;
omg so many scammers;1;;;;;;;;;
omg these oracle cloud services are completely retarded.;1;;;;;;;;;
Omg what's with the people on twitter, talking about ethereum beeing doomed because of that bug... Because of that I tought bug is still fixing. It's so crazy how easily you get misinformed. Thnx for the info guys +1: ;1;;;;;;;;;
omg wrong channel... it's like the c++ client has the plague or something.;1;;;;;;;;;

on a private net it should be quick....i was able to generate my block within seconds;0;;;;;;;;;
on all of them just like a cop would to someone that looks suspicous ;0;;;;;;;;;
On Debian you can dump a large file using `dd` from `/dev/zero` to your disk to assess the write performance.;0;;;;;;;;;
on linux you can do something as `netstat -W -n -p | grep geth`;0;;;;;;;;;
on my local it does, but my local does suck. so.. lol;1;;;;;;;;;

One single txs is only about a few ms. But if youâ€™re sending a shit ton of those it becomes a somewhat semi problem ;1;;;;;;;;;

or I'm doing some stupid mistake;0;;;;;;;;;
or just put a python 2.7 check in the beginning of the program and tell everyone else they are screwed, lol.;1;;;;;;;;;
Or maybe you're 1 block ahead of the network because you just mined it;0;;;;;;;;;
Or maybe you're on a different chain from the main chain because a miner just pushed in two new blocks that overwrite your head;0;;;;;;;;;
or proof that shit just isnt all that easy lol;1;;;;;;;;;
or some scumbag with time on his hands. wants to play;1;;;;;;;;;
or what was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back?;0;;;;;;;;;
or you can use `git rev-parse HEAD` if you build geth from the repo yourself;0;;;;;;;;;
Ouch, how much $$ did you lose CodeJynx?;0;;;;;;;;;
Our Crappy miner did 3 so far;1;;;;;;;;;
Our reviewers are lazy bastards ;1;;;;;;;;;
Outside of docs, what should one read to understand the technology? for example i am not sure what gas is and if it's a concept inheritent in blockchains or localised to ethereum.;0;;;;;;;;;
package node then takes care of hooking up the 'service' with p2p and the rpc server;0;;;;;;;;;
Parity is importing blocks with around 100-200ms elapsed time, while Geth was struggling importing a single block in 30 seconds. There is just no other way to say it, Geth code is crap.;1;;;;;;;;;

Please add that youâ€™ve imported your ether sale wallet and that mining failed after that (this is correct, right?);0;;;;;;;;;

pompom you have a lucky ass 290 :d my 7970 has mined 36 eth :D;1;;;;;;;;;
Possibly dumb question: I imported by Presale wallet twice into geth and now have two accounts with identical ids. Is it safe for me to delete them all from within geth and re-import afresh? (Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s safe to do so since as long as I have my import password I can re-create themâ€¦);0;;;;;;;;;
possibly stupid question: is the olympic testnet (or a new testnet) still accessible via geth 1.0.0?;0;;;;;;;;;

pretty sucky;1;;;;;;;;;
previously geth accumulated a ton of junk transactions (We Are The Borg had about 39K!), and for each new commit, you had to iterate over each of them and bin them out;0;;;;;;;;;
private net create an account that would be your main account and start mining for main account ...;0;;;;;;;;;
Probably a dumb question: how do you run geth in the background? I'm logged into a remote machine and don't wan't to depend on the terminal connection to it staying fresh. ;0;;;;;;;;;
Probably a stupid question, but I've sent a lot of txs that (apparently) exceeded the gas limit. Are these txs rejected entirely or are they in holding somewhere and might get executed like 2 years from now when the gas limit goes up?;0;;;;;;;;;
probably want to shoot these guys an e-mail?;0;;;;;;;;;
problem is that more mining power does not lead to more transactions getting mined;0;;;;;;;;;
Problem is that you must have win64 to run geth ;0;;;;;;;;;
procrastinating away.. time to sleep for me ;0;;;;;;;;;
ps: taking advantage of your stupid idea to use gitter, you can't delete my comments!;1;;;;;;;;;
put everything what? your keystore? testnet is still testnet, you just need the new genesis block to sync on Ropsten instead of Morden. testnet folders now contain a Geth folder where chaindata is kept, testnet chaindata used to be in testnet folder.;0;;;;;;;;;
"put this into a smart contract. ;) if (media.attacks > 5) { slander = new Lawsuit(); slander.lawsuit.start(); }";0;;;;;;;;;

SHA3 (Keccak) will likely be the simplest to improve, although not by a ton - the AMD compiler mangles any good implementation of SHA3 you give it - so I've gotten it to give me another wave in flight, although in the process making the code look like a drunken monkey wrote it.;0;;;;;;;;;

shittiest altcoin ever;1;;;;;;;;;
Shoot im running a 32 bit version;1;;;;;;;;;

Should miner.stop() stop the generating DAG percentage log entry or not? Is it possible to stop generating the DAG once it is started?;0;;;;;;;;;
Should never have deleted my main chain... that was dumb.;0;;;;;;;;;

so add(bytes32,int,int)  is part of Slave;0;;;;;;;;;
so any contracts you deploy in testrpc disappear;0;;;;;;;;;
so any partial db writes will murder the database;0;;;;;;;;;
So back to being a dick? I dont want to be giving out my ip in a chatbox. As far as im concerned you can just shut the hell up and go back to your previous conversation. Your not helping.;1;;;;;;;;;
so basically doing a --fast is useless?;0;;;;;;;;;
So basically its fucked;1;;;;;;;;;
so basically the main advantage then for you would be reactivity and minimongo;0;;;;;;;;;
so block explorers will be quite useful;0;;;;;;;;;
so changelly scammed me??;1;;;;;;;;;
So do I, so do I. :-) I would say, it is downloading faster than other versions into RAM.;0;;;;;;;;;

So ethclient is not smart enough to wait, right?;0;;;;;;;;;
so ethereum your syaing is not ethereum and the creator is the scammer then?;1;;;;;;;;;
so even someone with a relatively weak GPU will still be able to get some ether?;0;;;;;;;;;
so for a PRNG that gives you 256 bits of entropy you can do something like block.blockhash(block.number - 1);0;;;;;;;;;
so geth has been built as an ethereum client for a single user, right?;0;;;;;;;;;
So geth's hashrate reporting is just buggered?;1;;;;;;;;;
So if I want to run a geth client on testnet. Which version would you recommend?;0;;;;;;;;;
So if you choose to opt-out of the feed, you default to 0.  If you do nothing, you track some officially sponsored centralized feed.  If you are selfish and/or don't trust the feed, you manually set your gasPrice.;0;;;;;;;;;
so if you have a shit load of images but many have common cores;1;;;;;;;;;
so if you initially connect to a really shit one;1;;;;;;;;;
"so in short why ropsten boostrap appear to me as ""useless"" ?";0;;;;;;;;;
So is it possible to create web apps with go? or should I just suck it up and use JS even though it sucks;1;;;;;;;;;
so- is it possible to find out how long it takes for each opcode to execute;0;;;;;;;;;
so it will be something like cmake .. -DMINER=0 -DETHKEY=0 -DSOLIDITY=1 -DSERPENT=0 etclll ;0;;;;;;;;;
so it would help if you have a low memory environment;0;;;;;;;;;
so it would show which part of vmtrace fails, that is what ethereumj is doing;0;;;;;;;;;
so it's a bit fucking with my mind :));1;;;;;;;;;
"so kill({from: ""0x0j098aijdioajdioajd""})";0;;;;;;;;;
so many possibilities to try, so many different ways to kill the pi :P;0;;;;;;;;;
so my node can only connect to those, and even though I have a shitload of seed possibilities in my nodes db, they will *never* get inserted, since the old ones can never drop out from the table;1;;;;;;;;;
So now I have to go on an ether binge to break free from these corrupt goverment people to ensure survival;0;;;;;;;;;
so now if i kill it, the blockchain will get hosed?;0;;;;;;;;;

So running a validator on an RPi 3 would definitely be a dumb idea, but running a regular node would still be fine.;1;;;;;;;;;
So that is a mistery in Ethereum world.;0;;;;;;;;;
so that is not a networking issue but the downloader decided your peers were not worthy. slow or on the wrong chain, etc;0;;;;;;;;;
So the bloat turned out that I had to nuke and start over... so I nuked my geth testnet chain... but my eth one survived... (cause I neglected it). Then I had to perform CPR and get that shit going for genesis and now for mangy Olympic scraps.... it just wont die I tell you;1;;;;;;;;;
so the Go authors decided to screw it all, they won't allow any observed order;1;;;;;;;;;
so the peer's deemed useless and is dropped;0;;;;;;;;;
So there must be others that have the same misunderstanding I do... I thought I thoroughly researched how the blockchain works, but I've put myself in a bad situation. Sucks.;1;;;;;;;;;

so wasteful, would have been so much easier to send it to me;0;;;;;;;;;

so when I load `http://ppa.launchpad.net/ethereum/ethereum-dev/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/source/Sources` in my browser, I get a 404 as well;0;;;;;;;;;

so you can communicate with it directly or using a library like web3.js;0;;;;;;;;;

I started mining and mined 1 block.  i then turned off ethminer for some reason, and now i cannot seem to mine blocks.   i have tried deleting the blockchain, extra, and state folders from .ethereum.  I have tried regenerating different genesis blocks to load into geth.  moved the keystore folder and created new accounts.  I even deleted the DAGs.  restarted all apps several times.  rebooted machine.   Can anyone think of anything I may have missed?  ;0;;;;;;;;;

stupid statefulness;1;;;;;;;;;
Stupid stuff, trying to reset the network, missing a node, then the entire state comes back up, which is a feature obviously. Overloading nodes with transactions so everything stalls for hours but after a while it chuggs away the overload and becomes operational again. Accidently creating splits and it heals fast. Well done. Should be easy to test, likely you already do.;1;;;;;;;;;

The geth consesus only works with Ethash PoW, so if you could fake for your private chain, you should be able to fake to the main chain too, so probably not possible;0;;;;;;;;;
the hide you have calling me a liar after i lost over 1btc value to sketchy code;1;;;;;;;;;
the https://eth-status.org/ are mining on their own private network with beefy machines so their latency amongst themselves is very low and lets them lead the chain.;0;;;;;;;;;
the idea is simple, whenever a block is mined, the a strategy is notified, which may decide what to do with it;0;;;;;;;;;
The idea is to confuse the shit out of the olympic miners then you don't have to pay rewards...;1;;;;;;;;;
the last crash was a full system crash at about 28K blocks, it is now at about block 60K since I reset the geth.ipc permissions. the other crashes were all happening around 130K blocks of sync for a checksum mismatch.;0;;;;;;;;;
The low ceiling is incredibly frustrating. I have to factor my contracts down into absurdly tiny chunks to make them work.;0;;;;;;;;;
the max is 2**256 so knock your self out;1;;;;;;;;;
the mining at admin has started, but mine doesnt get pushed into a block(TX does not get executed) - I did a `miner.start(2)`;0;;;;;;;;;
the mist wallet is a piece of shit... i have problems with it malfunctioning nearly everyday;1;;;;;;;;;
"the mobster squirrel of ""shipit""! :smile: ";0;;;;;;;;;
the net connection is so poor that even gitter needs 3 mins to load;0;;;;;;;;;
The network state atm is really shite;1;;;;;;;;;
The new block gas limit - dumb question :) is this a limit 'globally' for each block? Its not a per contract gas limit per block is it. Just want to be clear. Also, does it only count actual gas used? Or does the gas limit count all gas sent e.g  includes gas refunds?;0;;;;;;;;;
the private key was decoded and kept in plain text form in the web3.py interface;0;;;;;;;;;
The problem is a sneaky russian pool or two would be able to build up rations now. They could lock us out of any rewards for some time to come.;1;;;;;;;;;
The problem is a sneaky russian pool or two would be able to build up rations now. They could lock us out of any rewards for some time to come.;0;;;;;;;;;
the problem is that mid write it aborted;0;;;;;;;;;
the problem is that the object that gets back via rpc has all hashes as int array .... at least that is what it looks like;0;;;;;;;;;
the problem is that with this fix you're not helping the network at all... esentially you're saying that if a peer's slow, then screw it, everybody drops, which will in turn make it even slower;1;;;;;;;;;
the problem is the  call to TestContractSkyDog.getnamecoin;0;;;;;;;;;
The problem is with the `hdwallet.NewMnemonic`;0;;;;;;;;;
The problem with SAAS and others is that when an API updated comes, you're screwed :D;1;;;;;;;;;
the promo is sitting on some desks since early July, if no one picks it up before end of year, i have author's go ahead to crowdsale promo in early 2017.  Sex, Droogs, Music: Nowt But Madness Left, to give the guys books a plug. lol.;1;;;;;;;;;
"The protocol should have had built in a last minute curve ball that limits a ""public IP"" from mining to much... this would have screwed any malicious miner's plans. Vitalk should understand that there are monsters out there and that good guys like him usually don't see it coming.";1;;;;;;;;;

the question is, how can you realize that all your peers are crappy? ;1;;;;;;;;;
the real world would be a middleground somewhere;0;;;;;;;;;
The release management is pretty bad, even with rebar :D;0;;;;;;;;;
the rest of geth, ssh, OS don't get crap;1;;;;;;;;;
The RPC works fine. Itâ€™s the bloody logs that need optimising;1;;;;;;;;;
The RPC works fine. Itâ€™s the bloody logs that need optimising ;1;;;;;;;;;
The second guy is even worse...;0;;;;;;;;;
the sendTransaction returns to me the address of the deployed contract;0;;;;;;;;;
the solution would be to specify where you wnt to put the unix socket manually;0;;;;;;;;;
The stats server's propagation time stat is useless.;0;;;;;;;;;
The string representation is just ugly ;1;;;;;;;;;
The testnet is prety much dead, probably most people left;0;;;;;;;;;
The triangle represents the South African Bermuda triangle... where your hard earned tax monies just disappear into an endless pit of corrupt government forever. Unlucky. ;0;;;;;;;;;
The wallet doesn't care about your chaindata, just about how to talk to the geth instance;0;;;;;;;;;
the yellow paper is so readable and easy to look things up in <3;0;;;;;;;;;
then everything dies;0;;;;;;;;;
Then I can understand the database error... if the process runs out of socket/fs allowance, it's hard killed by the OS;0;;;;;;;;;
then nobody cares if the old crypto gets cracked in 5-10 years, since you already have the laatest and greatest;0;;;;;;;;;
then propagation's dead... you need to wait for the downlaoder to sync back up;0;;;;;;;;;
then the monitor is fucked;1;;;;;;;;;
then why does `geth dump 2129949` contain only(?) 32k accounts?;0;;;;;;;;;
then you donâ€™t care about go/python/c++;0;;;;;;;;;
then your new tx will not be mined until your previous one mined;0;;;;;;;;;
there are damn many things;1;;;;;;;;;
There are no ugly girls, remove that word from your vocabulary.;1;;;;;;;;;
There are transactions going to that address all the time... It's a fucking scam address and a deliberate flaw in the software no doubt;1;;;;;;;;;
there is a fart joke in there somewhere... ;1;;;;;;;;;
There is an infura gitter channel you are probably better of there @machengxue707_twitter ;0;;;;;;;;;
there is no block explorer equivalent, but bet your ass there will be soon. ;1;;;;;;;;;
There is no security check in the world that can counter that stupidity;1;;;;;;;;;
There should be a package manager with open-source reusable modular components/packages for dapps to use/integrate with. Wallets, Authentication, etc. Why re-invent the wheel over and over again?;0;;;;;;;;;
There will be little insentive for the little guy to compete against a lopsided network... and ethereum needs the little guy otherwise what does decentralization really mean here? Decentralization as in 10 entities instead of 1. That would just be fail IMO;0;;;;;;;;;
Thereâ€™s no code that deletes datadirs unless thereâ€™s some serious screw up typo somewhere ;1;;;;;;;;;
there's a special header you can set in nginx to allow cors requests, I'm just using geth's rpccorsdomain flag tho;0;;;;;;;;;
there's another reason why ethereum is shit;1;;;;;;;;;
there's still an issue that dropped peer keep coming back to feed you junk;0;;;;;;;;;
these 2 are the bollock talkers ;1;;;;;;;;;

These damn rolling blackouts are not good for my mining rig though... that reminds me I must order that UPS.;1;;;;;;;;;
these fake releases likely have viruses or other malicious software in them;0;;;;;;;;;
these import times are after the blocks are already pulled and just their insertion time into the database took that much;0;;;;;;;;;

these little tasks are so so tedious;0;;;;;;;;;

they don't suck - normally, I look through OpenCL mining code and crings;1;;;;;;;;;
they got a block when difficulty was not increased yet and placed a max difficulty, and will start minig on top of it;0;;;;;;;;;
They have a de facto monopoly and they still fucked it up. how dumb must you be?;1;;;;;;;;;

this gitbook was maybe well-suited to the wild west theme of frontier, but honestly it's ugly as fck and was a pain to make it even remotely working.

this way it's clearer that `geth init` is a potentially destructive operation;0;;;;;;;;;
this would be an interesting template for a contract: automatic suicide. :) after some block number, your contract *automatically* kills itself and refunds your money. :+1:  (not sure why you might want that, but the idea just came to me.);0;;;;;;;;;
those are bad peers trying to feed you junk, and you dumping them;0;;;;;;;;;
Those blocks are so slow because they are the DoS attack blocks.;0;;;;;;;;;
Though I thought I'd share to get feedback if I did something very stupid :P;0;;;;;;;;;
though neither our old typemux nor our new event feed model provides a way to kill off slow subscribers;0;;;;;;;;;
though tbh I'd rather run 1.4.7 to avoid all the crap this soft fork put it;1;;;;;;;;;

Well, yeah, okay. Forgot that I always just suspend on my laptop, so I never have to generate a new one before mining. But just installed on desktop, and I shut that down and don't suspend, so I have to generate a new one everytime i boot. Sorry :D Brain fart!;1;;;;;;;;;

wth does geth keep crashing ? after eating all of the memory;1;;;;;;;;;
ww15bc: i think go-ethereum is for Solidity and pyethapp is for Serpent;0;;;;;;;;;
xD that would be lame;1;;;;;;;;;
Yay @tinybike @obscuren it works! Finally I can send ethers from an attached console;0;;;;;;;;;
"Yay @tinybike @obscuren it works! Finally I can send ethers from an attached console
";0;;;;;;;;;
yay will be fucking confusing for peeps but better screw everyone now :);1;;;;;;;;;
yay, docker hub crapped itself, the whole build service collapsed :D;1;;;;;;;;;
yea cool. im the same.hate all that shit. its a tool .lol.;1;;;;;;;;;
yea ethereum has had it's eye on PoS from the beginning. We have to get there. PoW is crappy;1;;;;;;;;;
Yea I am not going to get rich from mining. The 50 ethers I got is the only fuel I have then to make things work.;0;;;;;;;;;
Yea I am sure all developers will understand. But not the guys who fell into that hole;0;;;;;;;;;
Yea the local idiot power company;1;;;;;;;;;
Yea we got no damn electricity;1;;;;;;;;;
Yeah - CSS needs to die in a fire;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah ... it gets quite dirty ...;0;;;;;;;;;

Yeah and weâ€™ll validate and start kicking peers;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah bastards :D;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah crap;1;;;;;;;;;
"yeah exactly that. And on both node my geth version is
 ```
 Geth
 Version: 1.5.0-unstable
 Protocol Versions: [63 62]
 Network Id: 1
 Go Version: go1.5.1
 OS: linux
 GOPATH=
 GOROOT=/usr/lib/go
 ```";0;;;;;;;;;
yeah firefox and chrome...shall I kill everything and try...;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah hopefully someone should pay me for this shit ;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah i don't think there is --- alethzero has that logic but i think geth does not;0;;;;;;;;;
Yeah I got screwed on Ripple as well;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah Iâ€™m aware that these institutitons move slowâ€¦I was told in College that mainframe is never going to go awayâ€¦.I hope somebody does something about thatâ€¦because that shit needs to die. ;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah if preprocessor can be used inside that comment then that's going to be the easiest solution, albeit a bit ugly;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah if preprocessor can be used inside that comment then that's going to be the easiest solution, albeit a bit ugly;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah it sucks;1;;;;;;;;;
Yeah it's all internal functions though so if I want to work it out I'd have to recreate them.  Very ugly;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah saw it with Alex and Sven. Damn. :(;1;;;;;;;;;
Yeah the problem mainly is that it uses `flag.Parse` meannig we can no longer use it. If we call flag parse for the second time everything goes to shit ;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah those cpp slackers ... pfff;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah, but I'd really give a lot for an opportunity to punch them in the face :P;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah, crap.;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah, damn, I get no error... the curl calls just hang there;1;;;;;;;;;
"Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to dump the ""from"" in params. It still seems to want it";0;;;;;;;;;
yeah, I killed geth and think I managed to destroy my db;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah, I suck at javascript and I got it to work;1;;;;;;;;;
Yeah, Iâ€™m probably just going to implement this the *dumb* way and just track transactions sent by each account and use the `max` of all of their nonces.  Also nice to know I can use `pending` in `getTransactionCount`;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah, if you can make a json file, you can make a script;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah, it's just....I actually don't know how to pass this stupid thing raw bytes in JS;1;;;;;;;;;
"yeah, it's much more useful than the calculations I make in my head by repeatedly getting ""eth.blockNumber"" :)";0;;;;;;;;;
yeah, maybe do `git checkout -f` first to get rid of the merge;0;;;;;;;;;
Yeah, my 1.4.10 crashes with a panic and giant stack dump. I restarted it fresh using --fast sync and no chain state, and it crashed 5 minutes into the sync with the same panic. My 1.4.11 nodes just kill all resources and stop syncing.;0;;;;;;;;;
yeah, the one that doesnâ€™t go apeshit;1;;;;;;;;;
yeah, this is getting all sorts of fucked up;1;;;;;;;;;
Yeah, US is insane.;1;;;;;;;;;
Yeap, those blocks have so many friggin empty spam accounts that they take forever to sync.  New hardfork is suppposed to wipe them out.;1;;;;;;;;;

"years from now after weâ€™ve decentralized all the things, someone is going to pull up the gitter logs for this convro and wonder how these idiots coded up anything useful ;)";1;;;;;;;;;
"yell at me if I shouldn't post this here, but I keep getting ""Synchronization Failed: block downloading cancelled"".   ""Bad block #17211"" then it keeps download a selection of blocks from before block #17211. I'm on a fresh Ubuntu 15.04/Geth v1 - should I just delete my chain and resync? @obscuren";0;;;;;;;;;
Yep, I was only trying to alert them that it may not work for the noobs....;0;;;;;;;;;
Yep, looks good: e2a7fba02ebc43ab9499d96b86036ad0ea0e1ad5631d5602690b232a7031c2ef;0;;;;;;;;;
yes and the Jimmy Wales yearly begging campaigns are annoying;1;;;;;;;;;
yes exactly and some cunt in the Ethereum dev team is taking transactions like mine all day everyday;1;;;;;;;;;
Yes I can confirm current master branch geth on my server eats up all 32GB RAM, wtf;1;;;;;;;;;
Yes I would like to run the soft version of geth as well as soon as it is ready please.;0;;;;;;;;;
Yes it attracts dickheads like you... now go try sending a TOKEN to a null address before calling me a liar you asshole;1;;;;;;;;;
Yes of course if you know the pid you could kill it that way;0;;;;;;;;;
Yes troll miner... now you have my attention.;1;;;;;;;;;
yes what @karalabe said. it's just a pain in the ass for server developers;1;;;;;;;;;
yes, albeit slow tx times, but my --dev chain tx times are always ridiculously long;1;;;;;;;;;
yes, but the nonce is not the same value as teh priority;0;;;;;;;;;
yes, didn't include --testnet hah. Silly me. :);0;;;;;;;;;
yes, getting rid of chaindata should work;0;;;;;;;;;
Yes, I know how to attach, my question is, programmatically what's the best way to gracefully kill the process;0;;;;;;;;;
Yes, miners can vote the gas limit up or down on each block they mine, but only by a couple of percent;0;;;;;;;;;
Yes, most nodes only care about recent state. Garbage collecting old state is a difficult problem, though.;0;;;;;;;;;
"yes, ports opened:
 TCP_OUT 30300:30305,40400:40405
 UDP_OUT 30300:30305";0;;;;;;;;;
"yes, ports opened:
TCP_OUT 30300:30305,40400:40405
UDP_OUT 30300:30305";0;;;;;;;;;
"Yes, you should be mining; you don't need any extra logging flags in order to see blocks being mined.";0;;;;;;;;;
Yes. Ah well, haters gonna hate;0;;;;;;;;;
yes. everything is set up. the node pings my private bootnode which I can see in its console. What I want to do is stop my node from pinging ethereum main chain bootnodes. Looks like this is hardcoded in `/params/bootnodes.go`;0;;;;;;;;;
Yes. Itâ€™s more leveldb thatâ€™s a bit of a pain in the arse then anything else;1;;;;;;;;;
"Yes; if you don't specify any data the fallback function will be executed.";0;;;;;;;;;
Yesterday I took a peer into that code but I set it apart as it's very unfamiliar to me yet so thought I'd first check Felix's request and only then diverge;0;;;;;;;;;
yet if i said white people were bad at coding, a white wouldnt get triggered;1;;;;;;;;;
Yet the contract execution on etherscan shows no problems;0;;;;;;;;;
Yey! block mined. Thank you  simenfd!;0;;;;;;;;;
Yo I feel stupid. So, I'm trying to create a string variable to house my bytecode for deployment on geth, but whenever I paste the bytecode into the string (I use '0x<bytecode>') I get an error. What's going on?;0;;;;;;;;;
yobit is a scam site anyway please stay away.;1;;;;;;;;;
You  don't  need ssd, that's bullshit.;1;;;;;;;;;
You a pitbull or poodle? lol.;1;;;;;;;;;
you are a freaking champion! lolls:D;1;;;;;;;;;
you are adding insult to injury my friend, better get some sleep. apologies if my help is cryptic, i will try harder :);0;;;;;;;;;
You are already running a geth instance that is using port 30303;0;;;;;;;;;
you are good to go with 20 usd droplet then, without any ridiculous data transfer charges;1;;;;;;;;;
you are kind soul for dealing with my n00b crap, thank you;1;;;;;;;;;
You are missing a / @usafootballer ;0;;;;;;;;;
You are not getting what i want to achieve.;0;;;;;;;;;
you are not very good:P;0;;;;;;;;;
you are quite a negative person are you not? I have been part of this project since the beginning and fully understand the concepts involved in making an anonymous market work.  ;1;;;;;;;;;
you are quite a negative person are you not? I have been part of this project since the beginning and fully understand the concepts involved in making an anonymous market work.  ;0;;;;;;;;;
You are trying to jump out the protection of crypto currency;0;;;;;;;;;
You basically give away `G * GP` to a miner ;0;;;;;;;;;
You can also run geth with the `--pprof` option. Then you visit localhost:6060 and get a stack trace without the need to kill with SIGQUIT.;0;;;;;;;;;
You can also run geth with the `--pprof` option. Then you visit localhost:6060 and get a stack trace without the need to kill with SIGQUIT. ;0;;;;;;;;;
You can also use `puppeth` shipped with Geth 1.6 to deploy your own private networs without the hassle on setting up everything manually;0;;;;;;;;;
you can create your own multisig sceme ;0;;;;;;;;;
You can do a 'geth export', which will dump an rlp of all the blocks;0;;;;;;;;;
you can dump a full testnet sync!? :O no way.;0;;;;;;;;;
You can dump and load the full chain for any network;0;;;;;;;;;
"you can kill off PM2 
 ```
 ps auxwww | grep -i PM2 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 && rm -rf ~/.pm2 
 ```
 Check your configuration file";0;;;;;;;;;
you can look at your router's UPNP/NAT table;0;;;;;;;;;
You can play around with `â€”maxpendpeers`. Your pi will be less hammered by p2p requests and handle less ecies calls ;0;;;;;;;;;
you can print the full `fmt.Println(string(statedb.Dump()))`or print the trie `statedb.PrintRoot()`;0;;;;;;;;;
you can pull the latest from our release page and it will run fine;0;;;;;;;;;
"you can remove unwanted PPAs with
https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed";0;;;;;;;;;
You can run geth with `--whitelist=6485846=0x43f0cd1e5b1f9c4d5cda26c240b59ee4f1b510d0a185aa8fd476d091b0097a80` to force ignoring the non-forked chains and forcefully dropping peers that serve that up;0;;;;;;;;;
you can then pull it and just dump it instead of your existing one;0;;;;;;;;;
you canâ€™t spend more then 3.14 million gas per block?;0;;;;;;;;;
You cant find shit in this things archive;1;;;;;;;;;
you can't prevent people from being stupid. :smile: ;1;;;;;;;;;
You commnd seems a bit weird;1;;;;;;;;;
You corrupted your old data, updated develop because someone told you to, it merged your corrupted database to one and left you clueless;0;;;;;;;;;
You could grep your raw disk volume for the name to try and find it in a deleted file somewhere.;0;;;;;;;;;
You could try how it works by launching geth with `--vmodule=downloader=6`;0;;;;;;;;;
You could use --exec with loadScript;0;;;;;;;;;
you create a `geth.ipc` socket?;0;;;;;;;;;
You delete the entire geth  and `history`? Why history?;0;;;;;;;;;
you don't encounter any error if you try to do `geth attach ws://127.0.0.1:9546` ?;0;;;;;;;;;
you fail at speling penic!;1;;;;;;;;;
You got the full stack trace? Put it on gist. ;0;;;;;;;;;
you gotta do weird shit;1;;;;;;;;;
you guys are spamming this channel ;1;;;;;;;;;
you have a corruption because of the earlier crash ;0;;;;;;;;;
you have an exra s thre;0;;;;;;;;;
you have an old installation of leveldb;0;;;;;;;;;
you have cool friends, most of my friends are lazy as hell;1;;;;;;;;;
you have txA txB txC, and I have txC, txB, txA?;0;;;;;;;;;
you kids with your fancy pool mining;1;;;;;;;;;
You knew the number, you pwnd it;0;;;;;;;;;
you literally `kill -9`-ed it? :P;0;;;;;;;;;
you losing your token happen because of your error or a third party violation;0;;;;;;;;;
"You may however have to go in and rename or delete the mist.lokidb file, that sucker has ""loki"" in its extension for a reason.";1;;;;;;;;;
you mean like function blah() returns (bool _b, uint _c, byte1 _r) {};0;;;;;;;;;
you mean use a sockpuppet?;0;;;;;;;;;
you mean whatâ€™s up with aprilâ€™s fools day?;1;;;;;;;;;
You might consider blowing away your chaindata and restarting with --fast;0;;;;;;;;;
you might want to delete the old chain as well with `geth removedb`;0;;;;;;;;;
You most defnitely dont have to use web3.js;0;;;;;;;;;
you musnâ€™t be running the latest of the latest ;0;;;;;;;;;
YOU MUST BE A BIG FOOL;1;;;;;;;;;
You must think Iâ€™m an ass, and probably am, but Iâ€™m **not** telling you why it fails :-P;1;;;;;;;;;
you need `geth removedb` to resync;0;;;;;;;;;
You need the front end so that you can achieve user lock in.;0;;;;;;;;;
You need to also up the verbosity in your first geth. You have it set at 2 set it a little higher;0;;;;;;;;;
you need to create the `keystore` folder and all your trouble go away;0;;;;;;;;;
you need to kill your $GOPATH/pkg;0;;;;;;;;;
you need to remove chaindata as well;0;;;;;;;;;
You need to use `ethclient.PendingNonceAt()` to fetch the nonce and pass it to `types.NewTransaction()`;0;;;;;;;;;
you neeeeed go;0;;;;;;;;;
"You now need to do `geth init genesisfile.json; geth` instead.";0;;;;;;;;;
You now need to use `geth init` before `geth`;0;;;;;;;;;
you probably need to run `sudo npm install` first ;0;;;;;;;;;
You request a service, then they dispatch IT monkies that manually install a PC and install oracle on it and then send you a URL that manages this system. Only it takes.... uuhm months I guess. What  a joke.;0;;;;;;;;;
You request a service, then they dispatch IT monkies that manually install a PC and install oracle on it and then send you a URL that manages this system. Only it takes.... uuhm months I guess. What a joke.;1;;;;;;;;;
you screwed up!;1;;;;;;;;;
You should also probably just connect them directly via admin.addPeer;0;;;;;;;;;
You should be able to run geth on a micro instance.;0;;;;;;;;;
you should be able to trigger the same error when compiling directly with solc;0;;;;;;;;;
you should build geth with `-ldflags -s`;0;;;;;;;;;
you should do this on your own testnet;0;;;;;;;;;
you should NEVER go full retard....;1;;;;;;;;;
"You should probably disable your net intelligence until the rest of the network syncs with you or you sync with it ;)";0;;;;;;;;;
You should probably raise an issue in this repo's issue tracker.;0;;;;;;;;;
you should put it into a repo on your git;0;;;;;;;;;
You should see GETH messages saying it's starting....;0;;;;;;;;;
"You shouldn't have to interpret the logs bloom filter yourself at all; your client should do that for you.";0;;;;;;;;;
you sort of fucked up;1;;;;;;;;;
you still have shit laying around from poc 3 :clap: ;1;;;;;;;;;
You think you are decentralised but you are for from it ;1;;;;;;;;;
you were connected to an unfixed go client when you were getting blocks around #13477 but that was invalid, you kicked that client out;0;;;;;;;;;
you will need to know roughly how much gas your contract consume to be able to set the limit properly;0;;;;;;;;;
you will never be able to call out from a smart contract;0;;;;;;;;;
you won't see anything until you mined or received something;0;;;;;;;;;
youâ€™ll probably want to remove the ppa-installed version if you install it custom;0;;;;;;;;;
Youâ€™re boring.;1;;;;;;;;;
Youâ€™re gonna be sarcastic on me fabian?;0;;;;;;;;;
Youâ€™re in the wrong channel @dipibinny_twitter :);0;;;;;;;;;
youâ€™re on your own â€¦. traitor ;1;;;;;;;;;
youâ€™re wasting good electriticy ;0;;;;;;;;;
youâ€™ve corrupted your DB earlier so it wouldnâ€™t surprise me if it still is ;0;;;;;;;;;
you'd have to index every mapping addition to an array, and then iterate through the array...which is a bitch to do....;1;;;;;;;;;
you'll get a ton more junk logged out now :);0;;;;;;;;;
You'll need to remove the databse if you are stuck at an old block;0;;;;;;;;;
You'll need to resend that nonce with a proper gas price;0;;;;;;;;;
You'll screw up your database bigtime ;1;;;;;;;;;
your $GOPATH is wrong;0;;;;;;;;;
your choice anyway.. but watching this blockcount trickle upwards drove me nuts so i wanted to go and do something less boring instead;0;;;;;;;;;
your dapp should never use anything close to 4 million gas;0;;;;;;;;;
your db is screwed up mate;1;;;;;;;;;
Your description is extremely vague :);0;;;;;;;;;
Your go path is wrong;0;;;;;;;;;
Your leveldb dependency is stale;0;;;;;;;;;
Your myContract.withdraw call should return the txid;0;;;;;;;;;
your node is too slow;0;;;;;;;;;
Your nonsense comments. ;1;;;;;;;;;
your OS is runnign out of memory;0;;;;;;;;;
you're a huge hlp;0;;;;;;;;;
You're all gone, go to sleep;0;;;;;;;;;
you're mad i didn't pay you 1 eth up front i have screenshots;1;;;;;;;;;
You're the solidity man right @chriseth ;0;;;;;;;;;
"you've got a snitch ;)";1;;;;;;;;;
Yup, super duper annoying;1;;;;;;;;;
yup, that PR is just a dump of 3 of my other PRs pending merge;0;;;;;;;;;
yup, youâ€™re now a rich mofo;1;;;;;;;;;
