80,"(It took me a month to understand what this code was supposed to do, so who is being stupid here?:).
First, I find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area [1271-1279]. The largest area of these is taken for the comparisons [1282-1283], as this will be the actual destination area (copy/paste some blocks and you will see what I mean if my text is not clear).
The first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap [1284-1288]. When the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. As this may produce data loss (e.g. formulas that get wrong references), it _must_ be avoided. This code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. My first patch fixed only a part of that.
The second comparison [1294-1327] handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. This comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. Without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. Rainer Bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options.
I do this check by going from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. If not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shit option is disabled.
I feared a performance penalty with this method, but I tested it on an old. slow machine (complete build of Libreofiice takes 24hrs) with a destination area almost MAXROW high and that gave no noticeable delay.
But because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. Perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting.

I hope my proze give you the explanation you want.

I agree with the the aesthetic appeal of keeping fields and their types together. Other than that, I'm not convinced. I don't see why you need to inspect this object at all. I don't see the advantage of this over something as dumb as:

 I tried a few things but I'll keep it as-is if you don't object.
 
 Conceptually I want a ""Future<Boolean> testLoaderResult"" object for which I can set the boolean value without unblocking the test thread (in requestSeedFromService()), and then unblock it later (in onBackgroundWorkFinished()).
 
 Basing such on object on CallbackHelper might not be any better than what I have now; I can't explicitly protect the derived class' boolean with CallbackHelper's internal lock, so the boolean field would need to be handled just as carefully as MutableBoolean currently is.
 
 Basing the object on FutureTask is confusing because the Runnable/Callable has nothing to do.
 
 I could use CompletableFuture or BlockingQueue (like a Go channel) but those makes it difficult to separate setting the boolean from unblocking the test thread.",0

I wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem URLs, so I tried to use WaitForLoadStop(), which just exits immediately if a navigation hasn't started yet.  However, with blob: URLs, that still didn't work, because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side, so the ExecuteScript that sets location above returns before we've received the BeginNavigation from the renderer.  Hence this ugly extra dummy ExecuteScript.  Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when GetTextContent() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the BeginNavigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused GetRenderFrameHostsForExtension to fail.

correct -- it /could/ have been if base::Process::Open* fails. on the other hand, if base::Process::Open* succeeds but finds a proc with a different parent (due to pid reuse), we know that we should ignore this process.

> However, its child processes may not be killed yet, so we need to add its pid to the flat_map and continue hunting for the descendant processes. 

ah, i see. that's a good point. but if the pid was reused, we don't want to kill the new proc's kids! to be totally paranoid, OpenProcessIfChildOf would need to report to callers whether the pid was definitively reused or not. i think what you have now is good enough for test code. maybe drop a comment explaining the possibilities since it's a bit subtle.

> Either version works fine for this specific case as killing the direct child process automatically kills all the descendant processes (gpu, utility, etc) per my local tests.

yes, chrome puts its sub-procs in a job object so that they all should die with the parent. at least, i think that's how it works. you can probably test this trivially by killing a browser proc with plenty of subprocs. i think they evaporate straight away.",0

I'm doing some interpolation here from the u-boot stuff, and they were not very careful however. I'd like to leave this alone for now. Example: the win_id is 2 bits.

(1) Inspect the GcmDeviceInfo and the local device metadata. If they contain the same supported features, we are done.
(2) If they do not, then force enrollment/sync until they contain the same supported features.

In this scheme, we wouldn't need to worry about the ListValues at all, since we wouldn't be storing any values in preferences.

otherwise, i'm starting to think this is a mistake. we're doing command execution, but only in a very limited form. we're doing environment variable substitution, but badly. it feels like the best we can hope for is to achieve parity with the shell --- but we already have perfectly good shells.

your example provisioning script looks identical as a shell script except that each line starts with ""fastboot "".

the ""too much room for hacks"" is probably a good thing --- sooner or later there's going to be some custom bullshit an OEM needs you to do, and then you either hack that in to fastboot or have a separate shell script you need to run in addition to ""fastboot provision"". this is why Android's init is such an awful mess. they wanted it to be ""minimal"" but bad things happen when you collide with reality. especially in areas where OEMs are involved. the recovery image links in an arbitrary OEM-provided .so to solve the equivalent problem there. yeah, the shell's not lovely, but the alternatives all tend to be worse...

Getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print ""bah, your installed version sucks"", but also being able to print ""we detected that you have version xy installed, but we need at least version wz""

Also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field. Especially those that are not suitable to build (like 2.5.4 for example) print ""flex version <whatever version>"":
$ /usr/bin/flex -V | cut -d"" "" -f2 | sed 's/\.//'g
version

Also while your suggestion works for something like flex (where not much releases are expected), it doesn't account for increase/decrease of the digits in the minor/micro version part

while 2.5.36 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535, a hypothetical version 2.6.1 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check.

If you only want one single command, and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass, then one could use 

flex --version |awk '{split($NF,ver,"".""); printf(""%d%03d%03d"", ver[1], ver[2], ver[3])}'

Don't assign to the attribute intermediate values.  You mangle the hell out of boto_file throughout the following values- assign once the value has stabilized.

The reasons for this style don't strictly apply here, but the style should be used regardless since it's good form; basically, if ever dealing w/ cpy initializers, threading, etc, take your pick, having intermediate assignment like this means you've got varying state that can bite you in the ass.

Worse, if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization, if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance, the method can use that value w/out you getting an AttributeError; etc, thus assign once stable.

 It sounds like you've created a new channel for the decoder to inform the demuxer of a config change. If so, one thing to be aware of (assuming you're still using our decoder stream) is that signalling kConfigChanged from the demuxer will result in a flush of the decoder. Many config changes actually require a different decoder, so this makes sense. But in your case, this is probably wasteful. For videos that change size mid way through, we just signal the new size to the upper layers and avoid the heavy decoder flush.

as for _POSIX2_FORT_DEV, note the ""if"" in what POSIX actually says: ""If this symbol is defined in <unistd.h>, it shall be defined to be -1, 0, or 200809L."". the little ""[FD]"" next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra FD (Fortran Development). we don't have that, so we don't need to have any of the defines, and it's probably less confusing to just remove them. (though, as you say, in this case at least they let us set it to -1.)

if glibc doesn't have a macro, that probably means we don't need to either (and also probably means we _shouldn't_ have it --- i can't think of any part of POSIX we support that they don't).",1

 - every time the AP boots, we should have the same default sensor settings.
 - if the AP goes to suspend (S3) and wakes back up (S0) the settings shall not have changed.

2/ there *is* existing native code here that is probably buggy but just happens to work due to 1/. And some of this code is never going to be recompiled (if it were, it would be against a newer NDK, and the new code wouldn't have this problem).

But both of the above seem to imply that they only control inclusion/exclusion of debug data.  I think it would be conceivable that the flag could have deeper effects.  Say, do not deduplicate methods to make sure they can be identified, or omit some optimizations that rearrange code.

Okay, so we are really close now. The only thing I don't like is that we have both RK_CLRSETBITS() and RK_SETMSK() which do the same thing. We should have only one of the two.

Please just:

1. Remove RK_CLRSETBITS() and change everything that uses it to RK_SETMSK()

2. Change to #define RK_SETBITS(val) RK_SETMSK(val, val)

3. Change to #define RK_CLRBITS(val) RK_SETMSK(0, val)

Then we will be fine!

    - If you wanted to act on a failed attempt with a heavy handed TerminateProcess, you need to block even longer or delay stuff on the event loop. We don't want to do either here.

 I could probably share Fuchsia's with Linux's, but it'd still need to be a template then to handle ProcessReader, so it seemed less worthwhile since shoving it all in the header sort of sucks.

  self._ReallyDoStuff(myargs, cache_override)

It's subtle, but that block of code will incorrectly fallback to the internal cache if the passed in cache_override is {} (which may be entirely intentional- to force a run w/out using internal caches values).

The worst part about it is that the actual config loading API (cfgclient.Get) doesn't use ${appid}. Users will have to be careful to construct exact same strings as they use in validation patterns.

Do you have any suggestions?

I'm considering moving this placeholders shit up a layer into the root of the config library, so that both cfgclient and validation rules can use it (e.g. we'll be able to do cfgclient.Get(..., ""services/${appid}"", ...)). But it adds a weird-ass concept to already incredibly complicated API.

Hence this ugly extra dummy ExecuteScript.  Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when GetTextContent() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the BeginNavigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused GetRenderFrameHostsForExtension to fail.

Alternatively, I could wait for filesystem URLs to fail with a console error, similar to what Mustafa did on line 1118.

 We might need to worry about sqrt, but I'd need to profile. I'll try comparing performance to versions that stub out sqrt.
 
 It's not much of an issue on my desktop, where the *total* cost to record the 3 latency derived metrics is ~3us. It's >10us on my Pixel 1 though. That includes re-calculating a sqrt from N frames ago to subtract from the WindowedAnalyzer's accumulator. So there's 6 sqrts total per source frame (3 metrics * 2 sqrts).
 
 All the sqrts currently use double precision, but I'm pretty sure single precision would be good enough. In general, after getting the basics in place, I'd like to switch the double precision math over to single precision where we can.
 
 If we really need to, we could use a sqrt approximation. As long as the approximation is monotonic, it should be good at tracking relative performance deltas even if the absolute value might be off a bit.

6107,yea :) it's currently here because it was faster to assess it's performance. The removal stuff will need to be pulled out of the InstructionSimplifier as well to get this.,0
6108,"Yea, but my inclination here would be to not have this #define at all.  If this change proves to be performance neutral or better across more than just Caffienemark and we can convince ourselves that suspend coverage is complete, then I'd just do it and remove the existing code.  If not, I'd revert this patch.  Conditionally compiled modes are an invitation for destructive bit rot.",0
6109,"Yea, it is a bit messy - and particularly when considering arm32-style paired single registers.  I think a portable sameness test would be something like:

6202,"yes, feel free to just delete this line. i really don't care if somebody decides to pass random crap to powerd and we silently ignore it. :-P",1

6204,"Yes, I found the issue when the passwd entry was legitimately missing. I was surprised to see both arc-networkd processes running as root in `ps`.
 
 Under normal circumstances the entry shouldn't be missing, and the risk of something affecting *this* daemon is low. But security-critical code often gets attacked in ways that cause something that ""shouldn't"" fail to fail, e.g.
 
 - Maybe the bad guy can't write arbitrary contents into /etc/passwd, but (on a normal Linux box) he might be able to trick a careless cron job into erasing/clobbering its contents through symlink attacks. And then subsequent calls to getpwnam() fail.
 
 - Since Chrome OS uses dm-verity to protect the rootfs contents, somebody can't get the OS to return arbitrary data when reading a file. But maybe they can get the OS to return an I/O error if the file data is overwritten with bad content on disk.
 
 - Exhaustion attacks can sometimes induce failures that are useful to a hacker, e.g.
 
 https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/255-android-rooting
 
 What if somebody opens up 1023 file descriptors, then runs a setuid program that fails to open the 1024th FD and reacts in a careless way?
 
 - Linux veterans may remember this design flaw in the original POSIX capabilities scheme:

On the other hand, we can't create external/android-emu/ yet until we've completed the code and build-system refactoring, but that's where we should shoot at.",0
6222,"yes, that's the best choice for upstream NDK use.

you may or may not want to define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 for your own builds. (this only made it to the NDK around L, iirc, so it's probably not an option for upstream.)

(the other alternative, popular on Android, is to just always use the *64 variants. that works great unless you need to build on Mac OS too. they don't have any of this stupid compatibility cruft, which makes it especially sad that Android shipped with a 32-bit off_t :-( )",0
6223,"Yes, that's true. I only glanced at the first search result for posix mount when checking the original submission, and they used mount point for the name of the first parameter. My stupidity. The problem is that this isn't unit-testable because of the restrictions of the cpuinfo source.",0

6231,"Yes, unfortunately this does add some fragility here. Though you are wrong that it is inserting namespace data.

6239,"Yes.  Limitation of varargs macros, there has to be something there. The other workaround I've used is LOG_E(""%s"", ""No IV provided""), but I think that's uglier.",0
6240,"Yes. I don't know if it was strictly required for this CL (as ChildNeedsStyleRecalc() is cleared again on the way back up), Rakina can answer that, but the existing code would have marked the ancestor chain when dirtying a locked element since we start checking for display locking on the parent in MarkAncestors, so this should be a good thing regardless of the other part of this CL.",0
6241,"Yes. I want to remove the AsyncCompileJob before the promise gets resolved. However, therefore I have to keep the job alive somewhere after the job gets removed here.",0

 There are 3 scenarios thread_rm_active_adev will get called:
 1. the active device is set as inactive.
 2. the active device is un-plugged.
 3. operation on the adev failed, eg. append stream or playback fail.
 
 For #1, we should keep pinned streams and keep the adev active only for pinned streams.
 For #2, we should remove pinned streams (and notify client?)
 For #3, I think we should do as #2.
 
 How about add a ""keep_pinned_streams"" param to thread_rm_active_adev as an instruction?",0

Is there somewhere else I should be looking?
 
 Given that we have some code that appears to assume that a watcher triggering with a readable signal can always be read, and some that doesn't, it would seem making sure the documentation is clear about what assumptions can be made. Willing to give me a pointer to the documentation I should be considering updating?",0
